# linqinfer

## A lightweight and slightly experimental inference library for C# / LINQ

This library reflects my interest over the last few years in Bayesian probability, 
probabilistic reasoning and other means of inference.

It is both a learning exercise for myself and an attempt to create a useful
library which uses a fluent and LINQ-like approach to this type of problem solving.

See tests for usage examples.

It is still a work in progress.
