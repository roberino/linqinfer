# linqinfer

## A lightweight and slightly experimental inference library for C# / LINQ

This library reflects my interest over the last few years in Bayesian probability, 
probabilistic reasoning and other means of inference.

It is both a learning exercise for myself and an attempt to create a useful
library which uses a fluent and LINQ-like approach to this type of problem solving.

### Basic library layout

#### Learning

This is a collection of machine learning algorithms which are exposed through extention functions and operate on IQueryable sets of data.

* Self organising feature maps
* Simple statistical classifier
* Multi-layer neural network classifier

#### Maths

The Maths namespace consists of some basic numerical utilities including vector manipulation classes and fractions which can sometimes offer a nicer way of working with probabilities.

#### Maths.Probability 


### Examples

See tests for usage examples.

It is still a work in progress.
